<h1>2024 NBA Playoffs</h1>

<p1>As an avid fan of the NBA and the Dallas Mavericks, I wanted to generate new insights into the Mavericks playoff run. I primarily wanted to find what have been their key to success so far int he playoffs, by exploring which player staticts correlated most with win. Furthermore, I wanted to train a machine learning model on past playoff games in order to predict who will the 2024 NBA Finals. Finally, I wanted to explore the team statics of past champions over the course of the NBA.</p1>

<h2>Data Collection</h2>
<p2>My first step was to collect and clean the data to be used. I was able to collect data from a third party API which had several endpoints to send past and present NBA data. The code I used to collect and store this data into a csv file can be found in getStats.py and getAdvancedStats.py. These files collect data specifc to the 2024 Mavericks playoff run and past data for each NBA team respectfully. The data collect can be found in properally labeled csv files located int the same directory.</p2>

<p2>To determine what have been the Mavericks' key to winning in the playoffs, I explored which player stats closely correlated to the team winning. In the table above I highlight some of the most interesting findings. First are the stats of the Mavs' eletric rookie. Lively's presesne this season has been what the team has been missing for the past couple of seasons and his effects are highlted in this expierement. His personal fouls and points correlation coefficient reflect the importance the big man brings to the team. His personal fouls correlation coefficient of 0.6 suggest that when the rookie plays aggressive, the mavs' are also likely to win the game. The importance of his dominate play in the paint is furhter highlighted by the correlation coefficient of his points at 0.55. Through exploring these stats, it is clear that the mavs' rookie should  to continue his aggressive play in order to succeed.</p2>
<br></br>
<p2>The correlation coefficients found between Luka's stats and the team winning revealed some interesting findings. As the primary ball handler and scorer on the team, Luka's scoreing stats should correlate highly with the team's success. The data reflected this, however it also revelead that his shot selection may be even more imporant. This is suggested as his field goal percentage more stronlgy correlated with the team winning than his total number of points. Due to this, Mavs' fans should hope he takes smart shots rather than try to force more shots despite having the scoring prowess to warrant low-percentage shots.</p2>
<br></br>
<p2>While the correlation coefficients may be a good indicator of which stats correlate with the Mavericks winning, they do not imply causation. These stats only suggest that as the player statics change, the likelihood of the team winnning trends the same. </p2>

<p2>After analyzing their past performance, I wanted to see if I could build a machine learing model that could predict if the Mavs would beat the Celtics. To do this I decided to build a logistic regression model that could predict the probablity of the team winnning. I originally wanted to train the model on each game seen during the 2024 playoffs, however this would not be a sufficient amount of data to train the model. Therefore I collected data on each playoff game since 2020 and trained the model on this larger dataset. I decided to train the model on past NBA playoff games as opposed to all NBA games as the playoffs typically demostrate a different level of competion. Teams play much harder than the regular season during these games and each team is guaranteed to be one of the better teams in the league.</p2>
<br></br>
<h3>Feature Selection</h3>
<p2>When performing logistic regression it is important to choose features that are independent  Therefore I choose to select an even spread of features that captured the team's offensive success and defenisve success. To find the key features, I explored the correlation coefficients between the team stats and the team winning. After doing so, I found the best features that captured the team's success best with minimal correlation were points, steals, defencsive rebounds, assists, blocks, and field goal percentage.</p2>
<br></br>
<h3>Model Performance</h3>
<p2>The above table reveals the performace of the model I trained. During training, I was able to optimize the performance by standarizing the variables accross the features to ensure that larger variables didn't overpower other features. I also explored optimizing the hyperparameters, however I found that these made no significant improvements. If more data was available, I believe I could make the model more accurate. I think adding higher-level statics such as number of contested shots or the number of fans within the stadium would provide greater insights into how the team played.</p2>

<h3>Outcomes</h3>

<p2>To apply this year's Finals matchup, I averaged each team's 2024 playoff stats and used their team averages as inputs into the model. For each team, the model returned the liklihood of the team losing or winning. The above table shows the model's predictions unfortunately favoring the Celtics. However, there is still hope for Mavs fans as the model was didn't return a high liklihood of either outcome happening. There it would suggest that this serious could be close and come down to a few plays. The outcomes of this experiment motivate me to explore how the model would score previous Finals matchups. I would be curious to see if each Finals matchup would result in an unsure prediction as the two top teams in the league should be neck and neck. I would also be curious to see which serious in the history of the NBA was the most lopsided. </p2>
