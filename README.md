<h1>2024 NBA Playoffs</h1>

<p1>As an avid fan of the NBA and the Dallas Mavericks, I wanted to generate new insights into the Mavericks playoff run. I primarily wanted to find what have been their key to success so far int he playoffs, by exploring which player staticts correlated most with win. Furthermore, I wanted to train a machine learning model on past playoff games in order to predict who will the 2024 NBA Finals. Finally, I wanted to explore the team statics of past champions over the course of the NBA.</p1>

<h2>Data Collection</h2>
<p2>My first step was to collect and clean the data to be used. I was able to collect data from a third party API which had several endpoints to send past and present NBA data. The code I used to collect and store this data into a csv file can be found in getStats.py and getAdvancedStats.py. These files collect data specifc to the 2024 Mavericks playoff run and past data for each NBA team respectfully. The data collect can be found in properally labeled csv files located int the same directory.</p2>
